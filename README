I have made use of Python 2.7.3 programming/scripting environment.
Note: It is better to use an IDE such as Pycharm to run the program. You can download the
      free(community edition) version of the IDE from this link:
      http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Before running the program, please install the Natural Language Toolkit from this link:
http://www.nltk.org/install.html

"NaiveBayes.py" file is the executable file which contains the program for this assignment.

Execution:
    In the terminal type: python NaiveBayes.py

    Once you run the program, it will ask you for the path/directory name of positive files
    and then the negative files, as shown below:

    Enter the directory path which has positive files: <enter_path_or_directory_of_pos_files>
    Enter the directory path which has negative files: <enter_path_or_directory_of_neg_files>

    Once these are provided, the program splits the data for 10 fold cross validation and
    progress is displayed in the terminal/IDE.

Weka (Optional):
The folder also contains a file called NLP_IMDb.arff which is an input file for the Weka
software for the same IMDb dataset used in this project.
